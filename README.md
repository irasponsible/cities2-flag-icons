## About

The Asset Pack icons are baked on - so they're pasted over the top here. The Theme Icons are replaced with an svg of that country's flag, which have been simplified where needed.

## Use
To use these icons, you must install **Asset Icon Library** from [Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/79634/Windows).

Download and extract the zip file from [the releases page](https://github.com/irasponsible/cities2-flag-icons/releases). Then, add the files you want to the CustomThumbnails folder. 

Located here on Linux:  

    .../steam/steamapps/compatdata/949230/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Colossal Order/Cities Skylines II/ModsData/AssetIconLibrary/CustomThumbnails/

Located here on Windows:  

    ...\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\AssetIconLibrary\CustomThumbnails

As of `2024-11-20`, Asset Icon Library does not support files in subfolders, so move all the images into the CustomThumbnails folder, don't leave them in the sub-folders.

**You will need to have AIL set to replace default icons**. If you're like me and prefer the default zone icons and other stuff, you can copy those thumbnails from CS:II's game files into the CustomThumbnails folder too.

## Support for Region Packs
Currently, this has icons for the German and French packs, the first two to be released. I have [flags](https://github.com/irasponsible/cities2-flag-icons/blob/main/flags) ready to go for [the other content packs](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs) once they're released as well.  
I'm intending to use New England for the US Northeast Pack, Arizona or Califoria for US Southwest, and Poland or Ukraine for Eastern Europe, but I'll wait and see where the buildings pull their inspiration from.

## Questions
**Why isn't this on PDX Mods?**
- Modding Toolchain is a lost cause on Linux, so I can't use it
- I don't know C#
- There's no way to put this on PDX mods without those two.

If someone wants to package these into a mod, I'd be happy to work with someone - just can't do it myself at the moment.

**Can you move the flag to the left to match the vanilla Region icons?**  
I'd love to - but I don't have a copy of the the thumbnails without the stamp already on them. If you want to go through and cleanly remove the country-digraph stamp from every thumbnail, let me know.

**What about the San Fransisco DLC?**  
I tried, but for some reason it just wouldn't work. Ah well - it means I've got the California flag ready to go if it's a good fit for the US Southwest pack.

**Why is all of North America represented with just the US Flag?**  
You're welcome to make a Canadian option, but a "US/CA" mash up would just be illegible at this size.

**Why is the UK flag missing Northern Ireland?**  
The Union Jack just looks wonky when squished to a square. Either the edges don't line up, or the proportions look way off. I looked around to see how other people had done a 1:1 Union Jack, and they all looked just as bad.

**Will you add x?**  
I'll add all the official region packs and then after that, *shrug*. Dunno.
