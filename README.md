## About

The Asset Pack icons are baked on - so they're pasted over the top here. The Theme Icons are replaced with an svg of that country's flag, simplfied if needed, shown above.

## Use
To use these icons, you must install **Asset Icon Library** from [Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/79634/Windows).

Then, add the files you want to the CustomThumbnails folder;  
`...\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\AssetIconLibrary\CustomThumbnails`

As of `2024-11-20`, Asset Icon Library does not support files in subfilders, so you have to dump them all out into the CustomThumbnails folder.

## Support for Region Packs
Currently, this has icons for the German and French packs, the first two to be released. I have flags ready to go for [the other content packs](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs) once they're released as well.  
I'm intending to use New England for the US Northeast Pack, Arizona or Califoria for US Southwest, and Poland or Ukraine for Eastern Europe, but I'll wait and see where the buildings pull their inspiration from.

## Questions
**Can you move the flag to the left to match the vanilla Region icons?**  
I'd love to - but I don't have a copy of the the thumbnails without the stamp already on them. If you want to go through and cleanly remove the country-digraph stamp from every thumbnail, let me know.

**What about the San Fransisco DLC?**  
I tried, but for some reason it just wouldn't work. Ah well - it means I've got the California flag ready to go if it's a good fit for the US Southwest pack.

**Why is all of North America represented with just the US Flag?**  
You're welcome to make a Canadian option.

**Will you add x?**  
I'll add all the PDX region packs and then after that, *shrug*. Dunno.
