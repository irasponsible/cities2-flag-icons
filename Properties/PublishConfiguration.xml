	<LongDescription>
Use Flags instead of digraphs ("DE", "FR", "UK") or a map (NA) for regions and region packs.

The Theme Icons are replaced with a country's flag, which have been simplified a bit where needed.
The Asset Pack icons are baked on - so the flag is pasted over the top of the originals.

**Can you move the flag to the left to match the vanilla Region icons?**
I'd love to - but I don't have a copy of the thumbnails without the stamp already on them. If you want to go through and cleanly remove the country-digraph stamp from every thumbnail, let me know.

**Why is all of North America represented with just the US Flag?**
You're welcome to make a Canadian option, but a "US/CA" mash up would just be illegible at this size. You can delete `North American.svg` from the mod files to revert to the vanilla thumbnail, or copy the vanilla thumbnail to AIL's `CustomThumbnails` Folder.
