# [Region Flag Icons](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/95437/Windows)
Use Flags instead of digraphs ("DE", "FR", "UK", "EE") or a map (NA) for regions and region packs.

The Theme Icons are replaced with a country's flag, which have been simplified a bit where needed.
The Asset Pack icons are baked on - so the flag is pasted over the top of the originals.

*Icons generated by Irasponsible - Mod packaging and publishing by Konsi*

Currently, this has icons for the French, German, UK, Japan and Eastern Europe packs. Flags are ready to go for the other content packs once they're released as well.
I'm intending to use New England or Chicago for the US Northeast Pack, Arizona or California for US Southwest, but we'll wait and see where the buildings pull their inspiration from.
Based on the Development Diary for the Eastern Europe region pack, we've gone with a Ukrainian flag to represent the region, as that was the creators' stated first inspiration.
Signature Buildings with a specified origin have been given with a flag that identifies the region they are from. We're tossing up if we do this for service buildings in the pack too - it'll be a little bit more work, but figured we get the pack out sooner than later, and come back to it another time.
		
**Can you move the flag to the left to match the vanilla Region icons?**
I'd love to - but I don't have a copy of the thumbnails without the stamp already on them.

**Why is all of North America represented with just the US Flag?**
You can choose between the US and Canadian flags in the mod options.

**Why is all of Eastern Europe represented with just the Ukraine Flag?**
Read the text above.

**What about the San Francisco DLC?**
I tried, but for some reason it just wouldn't work. Ah well - it means I've got the California flag ready to go if it's a good fit for the US Southwest pack.

**Will you add** ***x*** **?**
Plan is to add all the official region packs, and then after that - not sure.
