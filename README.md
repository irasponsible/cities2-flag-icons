# Cities Skylines 2 - Flag Icons
Use Flags instead of digraphs ("DE", "FR", "UK") or a map (NA) for regions and region packs.

## About

The Theme Icons are replaced with an svg of that country's flag, which have been simplified a bit where needed.
The Asset Pack icons are baked on - so they're pasted over the top of the originals.

## Support for Region Packs
Currently, this has icons for the French, German, and UK packs, the first to be released. I have [flags](https://github.com/irasponsible/cities2-flag-icons/blob/main/ail/flags) ready to go for [the other content packs](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs) once they're released as well. I'm intending to use New England for the US Northeast Pack, Arizona or Califoria for US Southwest, and Poland or Ukraine for Eastern Europe, but I'll wait and see where the buildings pull their inspiration from.

## Questions
**Can you move the flag to the left to match the vanilla Region icons?**  
I'd love to - but I don't have a copy of the the thumbnails without the stamp already on them. If you want to go through and cleanly remove the country-digraph stamp from every thumbnail, let me know.

**What about the San Fransisco DLC?**  
I tried, but for some reason it just wouldn't work. Ah well - it means I've got the California flag ready to go if it's a good fit for the US Southwest pack.

**Will you add x?**  
I'll add all the official region packs and then after that, not sure.
